# Info and Help

Here is a selection of notes I originally kept on Google Keep. They are mainly common or useful commands and info that
is useful to have to hand when a precise command slips your memory.

I have notes in markdown files on the following topics:

- `GIT.md` = Git version control console commands, some Github stuff
- `BEM.md` = Block, Element, Modifier, a way to structure and name classes in CSS
- `CSS.md` = Cascading Style Sheet helpful syntax
- `General.md` = General programing info
- `Linux.md` = Info related to the Unix envrironment

I intend to add:

- ``

## Disclaimer

I have not thoroughly checked all these notes against the various documentation, it may be some commands
are outdated or just plain wrong. If you wish to use this as a basis for your own notes when cloning, be aware
that <u>using my notes is at your own risk!</u> I will do my best to check everything as I commit more.

## A usage suggestion

Using workspaces can be advantageous here. When you've cloned the repo to a folder, open it as a workspace in your current project and you can refer to the notes as and when needed.
